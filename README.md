# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-DSC530
DSC530 Final Project for Fall 2018

For the final project of DSC530, the used car database dataset has been taken from kaggle. This is one of the ideal dataset for performing EDA and taking a step towards data science. 
The dataset is taken from kaggle and contains details of the used cars in germany which are on sale on ebay.
The dataset is not clean and hence a lot of data cleaning is carried out. For e.g. prices where too high which are replaced by the median and outliers are removed accordingly. 
Also vehicles whose registration year was greater than 2016 and less than 1890 were removed from the dataset as this data is inconsistense and would yield incorrect results.
As per project instruction, the initial data analysis and cleansing part has been kept minimal and EDA part has been more elaborative.

Function to connect R to different data sources. Long term idea is to convert it in a R package. With various methods of the current solution, user should be able to connect to various data sources e.g. SQL Server and other databases, Azure SQL DB, open API etc and get data from the sources in the form of R data object, e.g. data frame.
